**Expense Tracker App**

**Description**: Build a web-based expense tracker that allows users to manage their personal finances. Users can add, categorize, and track their expenses over time. This project can teach you advanced React concepts while providing a practical application.

**Key Features**:

1. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to allow users to sign up, log in, and secure their financial data.

2. **Expense Entry**: Create forms to add new expenses with fields like description, amount, date, and category.

3. **Expense List**: Display a list of expenses, sortable by date or category, and provide options to edit or delete each entry.

4. **Category Management**: Allow users to create and manage expense categories.

5. **Expense Analytics**: Implement charts or graphs to visualize expense trends over time or by category using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.

6. **Search and Filters**: Add search functionality and filters to help users find specific expenses.

7. **Expense Totals**: Calculate and display the total expenses for different time periods (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly).

8. **Data Persistence**: Use local storage or a backend server (Node.js, Express, or any backend technology of your choice) to store and retrieve expense data.

9. **Responsive Design**: Ensure your app is mobile-friendly, so users can manage their expenses on various devices.

10. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for user interactions and network requests.

11. **Testing**: Write unit tests for components and functions using Jest and React Testing Library.

12. **Routing**: Use React Router to create separate pages for different views, like the expense list, expense details, and settings.

Building an expense tracker app will give you hands-on experience with state management, form handling, user authentication, data persistence, and data visualization in React. It's a project that can grow in complexity as you become more comfortable with React, making it an excellent choice for learning advanced React concepts.
